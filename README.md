# Google-Quest-QandA-Kaggle-Competition
This repository contains my work for the Google Quest Q&amp;A Kaggle Competition of January-February 2020. One workbook is dedicated to data exploration, the other for the actual modeling and generation of the submissions. I am currently experimenting with BERT, a pretrained Natural Language Processing model that just has to be fine tuned on the specific task. You can find the paper on BERT [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805v2).
